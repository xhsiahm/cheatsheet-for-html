# Hello
you could consder this a cheat sheet for html, which can be very useful for abslolute begenners. Its a simplified (not rlly but shortened) 
crash course. Throughout the code, there are many comments you are able to view to see what each tag does and its role in the 
code or "family" as some might say. This will be most effective if you fork and host this repository so you can see what everything 
fully does. Alternatively you could just copy and paste the code into a html code sandbox and see everything there. 
Hopefully this helps
